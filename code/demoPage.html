            <p>
                I am a student at Georgia Gwinnett College, and I am a senior majoring in Software Development.
                I started off college as a cell biology major, but that changed when I took a programming class.
                In the programming class, I realized that I really did not like biology anymore and that I wanted
                to progress further in software development.<br>

            <dt>Create an API that implements the category-partition method</dt>
            <dd>The API we made allowed us to apply a testing method called the category-partition method
                to a JSON file submitted by a user. The JSON file contained information about function and its parameters.
                Our job was to parse this file and create all the possible combination of parameters for a given function.
                We did this by creating an algorithm that would populate a matrix with the correct combinations. Once this
                was done, the API would write the contents to a text file and return it back to the user.

            <br><dt>Database that tracks a working train system</dt>
            <dd>In this project, I worked with another classmate to design a database
                that stores information regarding a train system. It tracked information such as:
                the trains, their cargo, and even their destination.</dd>
            <br><dt>Text-based Adventure Game Using Java</dt>
            <dd>In this Project, I worked with a team to create a text-based adventure
                game designed by another team. This game used a database to store information
                about new and returning players. It tracked each player's health, points, location
                items, and monsters defeated.</dd>
