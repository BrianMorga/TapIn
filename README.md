<h2>About Our Project</h2>
<p>The purpose of our project is to give athletes another way to share some information<br>
  about themselves in a quick and easy manner. Our goal is to have athelets modify a HTML page<br>
  with some quick details about who they are and what they do. The page will also allow them to link<br>
  their social media accounts for other people to follow. Once the page is created, we will link it to<br>
  a NFC chip so they can bring it with them and share it with anyone they encounter.<br>
  Our group is part of a program called Technology Ambassador Program (TAP). The goal of TAP is to use<br>
  creative technologies to help inspire future students to pursue a career in IT.<br>
